Analyze the ENTIRE video from start (0:00) to end timestamp. You must:
1. Watch the complete video duration
2. Track cursor/interactions continuously
3. Report ALL actions, no matter how minor
4. Identical actions should not happen consecutively
5. Generate a brief description for each action
6. Avoid repetition of previous actions
7. Confirm when you reach video end

Process:
1. Note video duration first
2. Scan chronologically in short segments
3. Report your current timestamp regularly
4. Signal when complete analysis is done
